**Description:** I have created this full pandas tutorial for get insight about overall pandas functionality in the project.<br>
                 All the processing files uploaded uder the **Resource** folder<br><br>

I have created this jupyter notebook to cover the pandas topics in concise manner.<br><br>

| 02 | Filtering and ordering |
| 03 | Indexing |
| 04 | Grouping and aggregate |
| 05 | Merging data frame|
| 06 | Visulization in pandas |
| 07 | Data cleaning in pandas |
